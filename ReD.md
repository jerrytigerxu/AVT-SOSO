**Q&R**
What are the top 2-3 things that makes your sales process most difficult or time-consuming?

Potential customers take too long to get back to me | so many emails

Waiting on the quotes or production’s feedback, as well as on the feedback from the customer

emails

Salesforce

Adjustments made the day of shipping out orders

If you could automate ONE task in your sales process, what would it be?

The constant back-and-forth with the production team

Set reminders after every quote that got sent

Making new web leads automatically be put into SF for us

Salesforce

Deleting packing lists or invoices from Salesforce within the opportunity without having to also delete it from the list that is shown when searching for PO# again

What is the ONE tool or technology you rely on most in your sales process? Is there anything about this tool you wish you could change or improve?

Salesforce - I wish we could automate more

Salesforce. More personal information accuracy (Ex: Addresses, Company name/codes, Payment terms)

What is the biggest communication challenge you face when collaborating with others in the sales team?

Those who aren’t in the office

Sales are very busy sometimes it's hard to interrupt them to come up with beneficial solutions for their problems. But once SF is clean all will be much easier.

Address adjustments or shipments not made in a timely manner.

What is the single biggest obstacle you regularly encounter when trying to close a deal?

They ghost me sometimes

Trying to find the balance between being a solution provider, and push to close the deal and not to scare the customer

Sometimes slow responses from production

Although I’m not sales, I would assume that if a customer has technical questions most of our sales cannot answer this. I am developing a FAQ meeting sheet and hopefully I can find someone to assist with this.

E1
How often do teams check email? → very very often → Outlook drives almost all of the important communication

What are the typical email response times? → for prospects it could take a long time (or they just get ghosted), and even for fellow team members (especially those in different time zones) it can take a very long time

Do they use any email filtering or organization tools currently? → to my knowledge it seems that they only use the most basic filtering and organization tools that Outlook provides

How do they track tasks or follow-ups related to emails? → to my knowledge they don’t do anything of the sort and instead rely on memory or on external reminders

E2
Are they overwhelmed by email volume? → I don’t think the volume itself is the issue but rather the amount of clutter

Do they struggle to find important emails? → it might take them a while because there are so many

Is inconsistent messaging a problem? → they have email templates that they use for specific types of messages (especially customer-facing)

Is it difficult to track email-related tasks and follow-ups? → they currently don’t do anything of the sort, and they especially want to maximize integration directly with Salesforce

S1
How often do teams use Salesforce? → Salesforce is being used more and more - they are pushing to make better use of it

What Salesforce features do they use most frequently? → just the very basic features of Salesforce (primarily the Sales Cloud CRM capabilities) - very few advanced features

How do they navigate between different objects and records? → they have objects based on company and based on the “depth of relationship” (prospects, customers, contacts, etc.) - they have a bunch of records for each of the records

Salesforce “objects” are like “classes” in object-oriented programming languages, “records” are like “objects” in OOP

How do they manage lead assignments and opportunity updates? → I’ll need to figure this out more, but it seems like things are still manual and clunky when it comes to “CRUD” operations on the Sales Cloud CRM

S2
Is data entry time-consuming? → Data-entry is definitely VERY time-consuming, as very few people are taking advantage of the automation capabilities

Are there issues with data accuracy or duplicates? → Yes, there is a big problem with regard to data accuracy and redundancy because of the manual “CRUD” process

Is Salesforce navigation confusing or inefficient? → Navigation itself isn’t too bad because of the search and filter options

Are there manual processes that could be automated?
