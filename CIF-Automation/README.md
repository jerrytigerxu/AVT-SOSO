## Phases
- ~~Convince the sales support team to shift to using an online form and leverage SF Web-to-Lead to save a lot of time and energy (for both parties)~~
- [**Test Phase**](https://github.com/jerrytigerxu/AVT-SOSO/blob/main/CIF-Automation/Test-Phase.md)
  - Designing the Web-to-lead form (content and style)
  - Building and testing the Salesforce flow (triggered when a new Lead record is created through the Web-to-Lead form)
  - Generate HTML and test the form and Flow to make sure everything works as expected
  - Embedding of form into the website (hidden link) and refinement (data validation, default values, and optimization)
- **Proof-of-concept phase (to give a demo to MM and Mimi)**
- **Production Phase**
- **PAC Phase**
  - Ensure the form is accessible and optimized for various devices
  - Consider incorporating features like conditional logic, progress bars, and a "save and continue later" option
  - Research wasy to save the form results as PDFs (so they can be filed away in OneDrive)
