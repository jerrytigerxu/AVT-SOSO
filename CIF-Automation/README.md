- ~~Convince the sales support team to shift to using an online form and leverage SF Web-to-Lead to save a lot of time and energy (for both parties)~~

  - ~~Designing the Web-to-lead form (content and style)~~
  - Building and testing the Salesforce flow (triggered when a new Prospect record is created through the Web-to-Lead form)
  - Generate HTML and test the form and Flow to make sure everything works as expected
  - Embedding of form into the website (hidden link) and refinement (data validation, default values, and optimization)
- **Proof-of-concept phase (to give a demo to MM and Mimi)** (12/11)
- **Production Phase** (12/11-12/13)
- **PAC Phase** (12/13)
  - Ensure the form is accessible and optimized for various devices
