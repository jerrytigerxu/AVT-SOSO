## Concrete steps

- ~~Convince the sales support team to shift to using an online form and leverage SF Web-to-Lead to save a lot of time and energy (for both parties)~~
    
- Test Phase (all four steps)
    
    - ~~Design the form content and style~~
        
    - ~~Test the results of the HTML form (does it update Prospects)~~
        
    - Map the result fields to the corresponding fields in the “Opportunity” object page (**using Flow**) → convert the generated Prospect into an Opportunity directly
        
    - Embed the form into the website (hidden link)
        
    - Refinement (data integrity - default values and validation rules to ensure data accuracy)
        
- Give a demo of the test workflow (“proof of concept) to MM and Mimi
    
- Production Phase
    
- PAC Phase
    
    - Ensure the form is accessible and optimized for various devices
        
    - Consider incorporating features like conditional logic, progress bars, and a “save and continue later” option
        
    - Research ways to save the form results as pdfs (so they can be filed away in OneDrive)
