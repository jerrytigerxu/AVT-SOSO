## Overview
- The purpose of this project is to reduce manual labor and to cut down potential errors in CRUD operations for Salesforce - instead of manually copying the information from the CIF form into Salesforce, we can use Salesforce's Web-to-lead functionality to directly create Salesforce Opportunities. 

## Phases (12/3 - 12/13)
- ~~Convince the sales support team to shift to using an online form and leverage SF Web-to-Lead to save a lot of time and energy (for both parties)~~
- ~~[**Test Phase**](https://github.com/jerrytigerxu/AVT-SOSO/blob/main/CIF-Automation/Test-Phase.md) (12/3-10)~~
  - ~~Designing the Web-to-lead form (content and style)~~
  - ~~(suspended) Building and testing the Salesforce flow (triggered when a new Prospect record is created through the Web-to-Lead HTML form)~~
- **Proof-of-concept phase (to give a demo to MM and Mimi | talk about whether or not we need to directly automate the conversion to Prospect or leave the SOS team to handle that)** (12/10)
- **Production Phase** (12/10-12/12)
  - Embedding of form into the website (hidden link) and refinement (data validation, default values, and optimization)
- **PAC Phase** (12/13)
  - Ensure the form is accessible and optimized for various devices
  - Consider incorporating features like conditional logic, progress bars, and a "save and continue later" option
  - Research ways to save the form results as PDFs (so they can be filed away in OneDrive)
