## PAC Phase (12/23-1/31)

### Finalization

- ~~B. Plan out Streamlining (handing off and making training materials) (1/15)~~
- ~~C. More tweaking (1/16-17)~~
  - ~~Let the marketing team and sales support team know that Johnny is okay with us moving forward~~
  - ~~Embed the HTML into the AVT website and make it look nice~~

    - Do actual test runs
    - Facilitate making this procedure the "new way" (train everyone involved)
      - Change the recipient email address to CS 
      - Have the original PDF workflow ready if that's what customers want to do (but don't promote it - always have the automated form be the default option)
