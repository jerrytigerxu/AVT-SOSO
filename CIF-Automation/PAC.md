## PAC Phase (12/23-1/31)
Form refinement (data validation, default values, required fields, and styling)
Have an email automatically be sent to CS that also has an attachment of the form results
Finalization
(completed) Get approval of Johnny
Get more feedback on the form functionality and styling before fully implementing (and "deploying" for regular use)
Embed the HTML into the AVT website and make it look nice
Plan out Streamlining (handing off and making training materials)
Considerations: have the original PDF workflow ready if that's what customers want to do (but don't promote it - always have the automated form be the default option)
Further refine the email template if necessary
Change the recipient email address to CS
