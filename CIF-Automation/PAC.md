## PAC Phase (12/23-1/31)
- ~~Form refinement (data validation, default values, required fields, and styling)~~
- ~~Have an email automatically be sent to CS that also has an attachment of the form results~~


### Finalization
- ~~(completed) A. Get approval of Johnny~~
- ~~B. Plan out Streamlining (handing off and making training materials) (1/15)~~
- C. More tweaking (1/16-17)
  - Let the marketing team and sales support team know that Johnny is okay with us moving forward
  - Get more feedback on the form functionality and styling before fully implementing (and "deploying" for regular use)
  - Embed the HTML into the AVT website and make it look nice
  - Further refine the email template if necessary
- D. Deployment (1/20-24)
  - Change the recipient email address to CS
  - Do actual test runs
  - Create training materials (final video demonstration of the whole process, document for the procedure)
  - Facilitate making this procedure the "new way" (train everyone involved)
    - Have the original PDF workflow ready if that's what customers want to do (but don't promote it - always have the automated form be the default option)
